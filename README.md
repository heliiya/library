eLibrary Project 

This project is a web application that give you a library manager, that has two role admin and librarian. 

Admin section: add librarian, edit librarian, delete librarian, view librarian, add book, delete book, view book, view issued book 

Librarian section: view book, view my issued book, issue book, return book. 

For use this app you should run mongoDB on your pc.
For the first time that you run application, one admin added to your DB and you can see his/her email and password and login with that. 

Notice that, it is my first project using Spring and mongoDB, 
so maybe I didn’t use best practice code, and I certainly back to code and change something if necessary. 
Especially because I use Thymeleaf library in my project, I was forced to confuse encapsulation of model's classes. 
I don’t know it’s correct or not but I read document of MVC Spring that write model classes are POJO, 
so I decided to choose this pattern but I need to search more and maybe change this. 

Regards.
